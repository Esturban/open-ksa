    "# Example Workbook for Using APIs to Download Data from Organizations\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use APIs to download data from a specific organization and provider. The example uses the search functionality from the original website: [Saudi Open Data](https://open.data.gov.sa/en/publishers).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Import the required functions from the `open_ksa` module.\n",
    "2. **Search for Organizations**: Use the search function to find organizations based on a keyword.\n",
    "3. **Retrieve Organization ID**: Extract the organization ID from the search results.\n",
    "4. **Get Organization Resources**: Fetch all dataset IDs and other resources associated with the organization.\n",
    "5. **Download Data**: Download the datasets to a specified directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps 1 and 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we showcase how the modules are imported and the organizations are found in the search in the process of discovery based on certain key word term.\n"
